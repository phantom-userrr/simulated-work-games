    •	This ensures smooth gameplay and prevents frustrating repeat positions

## Future Enhancements 🌟
    •	Add difficulty levels with faster mole speeds or more holes
    •	Include sound effects for whacking moles
    •	Track and display the best score
    •	Add themed variations (e.g., whack-a-monster or whack-a-fruit)
